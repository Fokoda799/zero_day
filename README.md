# Project: Vagrant and Virtual Machines

## Overview

In this project, we explore the power of Vagrant in managing and provisioning Virtual Machines (VMs). Vagrant is a tool that enables developers to create and configure consistent development environments across different platforms. It's particularly useful for setting up VMs that mirror production environments.

## Goals

- **What is a virtual machine**

- **What is Vagrant** 

- **Who wrote Vagrant**

- **What is Ubuntu**

- **What does “Ubuntu” mean**

- **How to use VMs with Vagrant**

- **What does the command 'uname' do** 

## Technologies Used

- **Vagrant:** A tool for building and managing virtualized development environments.

- **VirtualBox:** A powerful open-source virtualization product.

- **Ubuntu:** A popular and user-friendly Linux distribution.

## Project Steps

1. **Install Prerequisites:** Set up VirtualBox and Vagrant on your local machine.
   
2. **Initialize a Vagrant Project:** Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal. Run:
